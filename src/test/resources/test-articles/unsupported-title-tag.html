<div><p><br>Though San Salvador’s Mercado Central is statistically one of the most dangerous zones of one of the most dangerous cities in the world, an outsider wouldn’t know it just by walking through. It is, admittedly, congested, stretching across a few dozen blocks that throb with tens of thousands of vendors, clogging the roads of the Salvadoran capital’s heart with makeshift stalls and tables that spill over with anything you could think to buy: stacks of clothes and fruit, underwear, cheap plastic toys, bars of soap, knockoffs of coveted North American brands—Levis, Converse, Adidas, Nike. Women hawk tamales and bags of cut papaya, or ladle steaming coffee into flimsy Styrofoam cups that buckle from the heat. Boys push wheelbarrows of ice water, bananas, and mangos past rows of mannequins modeling cheap leggings for sale. This is one-stop shopping at its most frenetic. Life and commerce thrum. Violence here is largely invisible—until, of course, it&nbsp;isn’t.</p>

        Part of Bukele’s effectiveness as a politician stems from his commitment to his own creation—namely, the Nayib Bukele brand. His cerulean signs, emblazoned with self-congratulatory slogans—new ideas are invincible; revitalization of the historic center; your city works for you—adorn the city like flags, often cordoning off construction zones like caution tape. Six months into his tenure, he redesigned the city’s seal, which he now wears pinned to a blue blazer or, more commonly, a slick navy Members Only–style jacket he sports over a white-collared shirt. Reminders of his influence mark the city like a kind of municipal graffiti. Few seem to scoff at this self-congratulatory blitz. Unlike the civil-war years, when one’s political allegiance was often motivated by fear of dying a traitor’s death, Bukele’s fans adore him freely, emboldened, perhaps, by the feeling that they are choosing someone who does not appear confined by political tradition. In fact, he’s long since become disenchanted with his own party, the FMLN, and he’s outspokenly critical of its leadership—something that only increases his popularity and the sense that he operates according to his principles rather than to political&nbsp;allegiances.
